    "1. Consider forecasting `sales` on `2018-01-01`. In a one-step-ahead scenario, the forecast would have to be constructed on `2017-12-31`. The most recent value of `sales` available on that date is not known to us - lag features almost always have this \"initial condition\" problem. Hence the value of `sales_lag1` for `2018-01-01` should be `NaN`.\n",
    "1. Next, consider forecasting `sales` on `2018-01-02`. In a one-step-ahead scenario, the forecast would have to be constructed on `2018-01-01`. The most recent value of `sales` available on that date is valu of `sales` from `2018-01-01`, which is `1.0`, hence the value of `sales_lag1` for `2018-01-02` should be `1.0`.\n",

    "1. When forecast is made on `2017-12-31`, i.e. a two-steps-ahead forecast, value of `sales_lag1` is not available, because `sales` are not known to us in `2017`.\n",

    "  * A naive application of the lag operation would suggest that the value of `sales_lag1` for that row should be value of `sales` from `2018-01-02` - this is, after all, the value from one day prior to the date being forecasted.\n",
    "  * The above naive interpretation would make us use `NaN` value instead of `1`, because on `2018-01-01` value of sales on `2018-01-02` is not yet known.\n",
    "  * Instead, we fall back to our definition: _the value of `lag1` is the most recent value that is known to us at the time of constructing the forecast_. The most recent value of `sales` known on `2018-01-01` is `1`, which is what we use."

    "In a typical data science scenario, the training-testing data split happens randomly, because all records are interchangeable. In time series, this is a recipe for overfitting, and splits have to be done by time, with older data being in the training set, and newer data in the test set.\n",
